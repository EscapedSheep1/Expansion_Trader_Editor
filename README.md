# Expansion_Trader_Editor


Step 1. Create a Folder for your "Project" and inside make 3 folders, Market, Traders & Types.

Step 2. Copy your Market & Trader files from profiles\expansion into these folders

Step 3. Copy your mpmission\missionname\db\types.xml into the types folder as well as any custom types files you are using. (Do not put them in subfolders in the types folder as the app will not see them)

Step 4. Launch the program, click the buttons for folders at the top to set the folder locations to the ones you made earlier.

Step 5. Press File->Save Project and save this file anywhere you please. Now when you launch the app the next time you can File->Load the project file and it will have all the folders setup for you!

This is in active development so please let me know if you have any suggestions / bugs!
